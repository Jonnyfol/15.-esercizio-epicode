              <p>I had a dream
                I had a dream when I was only five
                To work at a bar, I wanted to see over the other side
                And I had a friend, her name was Fern and she had a blue bike
                So we'd ride through the streets
                And I would sleep over on Saturday nights
                Then I went to school
                My family moved to a village near by
                At thirteen years old I started drawing black under my eyes
                Cos I met a boy, first time I kissed him on the lip was the last
                Cos I got afraid when everyone there started moving too fast
                These are the moments I'm missing
                These are the moments I never took in
                When I was just standing there wishing
                I could grow up and my life would be different
                These are the moments I miss
                These are the moments
                These are the moments I'm missing
                These are the moments
                Cos I've been so caught in the motion
                Forgetting right where my home is
                These are the moments I'm missing
                In the back of her mum's car on the way to the old bars, yeah
                Raising my anxiety using her sisters ID, yeah
                In a skintight short skin, sixteen and we danced till our feet hurt
                But I had a dream, I had a goal
                Got a guitar and a camera phone
                Then over the time I started racking up numbers online
                At the end of July I met somebody who changed my life
                And then I'm signed and falling in love for the very first time
                But that fucked me up so then I had issues with falling in love
                These are the moments I'm missing
                There are the moments I never took in
                When I was just standing there wishing
                I could grow up and my life would be different
                These are the moments I miss
                These are the moments
                These are the moments I'm missing
                These are the moments
                Cos I've been so caught in the motion
                Forgetting right where my home is
                These are the moments I'm missing
                Gone in the snow, nothing there for me
                I had to let go, found the world on my own
                Wondering, looking for where to call home
                With the beat of a guitar and a bunch of flowers to endlessly roam
                Never did have a car, but I got a few friends to help me along
                Then I met a few girls in the City of Angels
                Thought they all were the one, but they all ran away
                So I've been writing these songs all about loving, about finding
                Oh I'm alone, I don't know where to go, all I know is.
                These are the moments I'm missing
                Cos I've been so caught in the motions
                Forgotten right where my home is
                These are the moments I'm missing
                Cos I've been so caught in the motions
                Forgotten where my home is
                These are the moments I'm missing
                These are the moments I'm missing
                These are the moments I'm missing
                These are the moments I'm missing
                These are the moments I'm missing
                These are the moments I'm missing
                These are the moments I'm missing
                These are the moments I'm missing
                These are the moments I'm missing</p>
